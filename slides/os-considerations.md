Notes:
- OS: Long term maintenance.</br>
- Can mitigate this by sponsoring. For example, Insum recently sponsored a project on OOS. It was cheaper for them then to build/manage themselves.
- Build: Maintenance.</br>
- Buy: Is it worth it, pay more than you just need. Security?

- <i class="fa fa-square-o"></i> How active is the project?
- <i class="fa fa-square-o"></i> Can you inherit the project?
- <i class="fa fa-square-o"></i> How popular is the project?

Notes:
- If you decide to use an OS project, there are some things to consider.
