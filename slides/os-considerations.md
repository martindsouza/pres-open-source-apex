![OS vs Build vs Buy](www/img/os-build-buy.png)

Notes:
- OS: Long term maintenance.</br>
- Can mitigate this by sponsoring. For example, Insum recently sponsored a project on OOS. It was cheaper for them then to build/manage themselves.
- Build: Maintenance.</br>
- Buy: Is it worth it, pay more than you just need. Security?
