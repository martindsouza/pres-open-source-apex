![Mom](www/img/martin_mom.jpg)

Notes:
- Follow examples will compare git to sharing recipes with my mom.

# <i class="fa fa-git"></i> `clone`

Notes:
- Photo copy a recipe from my mom.</br>
- Copy a repo to your personal version.</br>
- GitHub calls this a [fork](https://guides.github.com/activities/forking/).

## <i class="fa fa-git"></i> `add` / `commit`

Notes:
- Make changes to recipe and put changes back in my recipe box.</br>
- `add`: Flags file to be committed.</br>
- `commit`: Actually commit the change to repo.</br>

# <i class="fa fa-git"></i> `push`

Notes:
- Push your changes to the cloud repo (in this case GitHub/BitBucket).

# <i class="fa fa-git"></i> Pull Request

Notes:
- I then call my mom and tell her I made a change to the recipe. She can then decide wether to accept or reject the change.</br>
- I.e. I ask her to "pull" in my changes. </br>
- [GitHub Pull Request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests/).</br>
- [BitBucket Pull Request](It would be the same as having 10 national team players for Germany then adding me).

# <i class="fa fa-git"></i> `pull`

Notes:
- My sister who's also been following my mom's recipe then does a `git pull` and gets the update.
